# Development model card

The `development_v8_seed11.zip` asset contains **development-only**, single-seed H and H0 policies. It is not the final research model, a safety-certified controller, or an autonomous-road-driving product.

| Model | Physical training steps | PPO optimization phases | Development completion |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| H | 201,117 | 79 | 8/10 |
| H0 | 201,115 | 79 | 6/10 |

Both policies use SB3 PPO, separate two-layer64-unit actor/value networks,31 joint local-goal/speed actions,450 observation values,0.05s physical controls and0.5s high-level decisions. Training samples empty/static/narrow/dynamic scenarios; the configured extra obstacle count is0, but each nonempty family still generates its defining obstacles. Evaluation includes an additional unseen-layout family. The two development conditions per family are not a diverse independent confirmation set.

H receives99 additional features:31 candidate geometric witnesses/travel proxies and six previous-execution outcomes. H0 receives zeros in the same slots; network shapes and low level match. Candidate analytic witnesses are sufficient geometric checks for that connection, not guarantees that Hybrid A* succeeds, that tracking is safe, or that dynamic interactions succeed. No policy action is masked or replaced by a rule.

The asset includes frozen source, weights, observation normalization, configuration/signature, optimizer and training-episode summaries, and all ten200k evaluation traces per policy. Exact model and file hashes are in `manifest.json`. The original full training transition logs remain in the local experiment archive; this bounded asset does not contain every training transition or CARLA binaries/videos.

Known limitations: both200k policies fail the unseen lightweight layout; the200k H/H0 difference disappears at300k (8/10 each, with different failed families). Frozen200k transfer to the calibrated CARLA vehicle gives2/6 for each policy. Failure cases repeatedly select unplannable goals and brake. The asset demonstrates reproducible learned closed-loop execution, not an established feedback advantage or generalization claim.

Only load serialization files from a trusted, hash-verified source. The reproduction command verifies every listed file, uses the bundled frozen source, freezes normalization, rebuilds the development endpoint figure and checks all requested replay outcomes against saved raw results.
